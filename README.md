"Full_almostFull20 " contains code, results about full and almost full stations with interval time=20, delta S=3,  delta T=3. Results are filtered by at least 2 time windows, at least a T0 and delta 0. Inside "2windows_T0_delta0" there are the results about this filter and two folders containing results about patterns that have both almost full and full stations and patterns with at least 1 T0, delta S=0 and at least one pattern with delta S different from 0 and delta T different from 0. The se 2 filters are applied to the first one. 
The file " results_1000_0" means results with 1000 as spatial threshold, 0 support.

"Full_almostFull30 " contains code, results about full and almost full stations with interval time=20, delta S=3,  delta T=3. Results are filtered by at least 2 time windows, at least a T0 and delta 0. Inside "2windows_T0_delta0" there are the results about this filter and two folders containing results about patterns that have both almost full and full stations and patterns with at least 1 T0, delta S=0 and at least one pattern with delta S different from 0 and delta T different from 0. The se 2 filters are applied to the first one. 
The file " results_1000_0" means results with 1000 as spatial threshold, 0 support.

"StateChange_Full_almostFull_10 " contains code, plots, results about full and almost full stations that change state from one timestamp to an another with interval time=10, delta S=3,  delta T=3. Results are filtered by at least 2 time windows, at least a T0 and delta 0. Inside "2windows_T0_delta0" there are the results about this filter and two folders containing results about patterns that have both almost full and full stations and patterns with at least 1 T0, delta S=0 and at least one pattern with delta S different from 0 and delta T different from 0.
